# prime-pw-week-5-assignment

Here we'll take a look at using a prototype class and explore creating a new object from this class. Also, we'll delve into the basics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) by using properties and methods of an object derived from a prototype.

## Topics Covered
* Creating a new object from a prototype class
* Accessing data within an object
* Adding a method to an object
* Calling an object's method

You can refer to the Codeacademy lesson JavaScript 8 (Objects II) for reference if needed.

## Assignment
As always start off by forking and cloning this repository from Github. Open the code in Atom to get started.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't forget to _keep the existing code as is_ and ignore any code that is commented: `// -- DON'T TOUCH CODE BELOW --`.

Finally, remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go.

### Files Provided

This week you'll be completing the scripts in the following files. But note, that we have different levels of difficulty contained within each file.

- [ ] *1_prototypes.js* (Base, Hard)
- [ ] *2_bringItTogether.js* (Pro)

Similar to last week's assignment, each script has some code ready for you with comments telling you what to write. Take the following as an example.

It may have originally been assigned like this:

```javascript
function tripleThis( number ){
  // this function accepts a number as an argument
  // write code that triples the number given
  // return this new, higher number
} // end tripleThis
```

After doing your work, it might look something like the following:

```javascript
function tripleThis( number ){
  // this function accepts a number as an argument
  // write code that triples the number given
  var answer = number * 3;
  // return this new, higher number
  return answer;
} // end tripleThis
```

#### Modes

Above, we introduced the concept of levels of difficulty. "Mode" is how we will typically refer to each level. Below is a brief explanation of

* what to expect when attempting each mode
* if they are required or not

Mode | Description
---  | ---
Base | required 
Hard | optional, stretches your understanding
Pro  | optional, stretches your understanding and may require additional research

#### Pro Mode Details
In *bringItTogether.js* there are many tasks that take multiple steps to complete.

The problem description is in a separate markdown file: [bringItTogether.md](bringItTogether.md). Good luck!

**IMPORTANT:** You will need to source this file into the *index.html*.

### Assignment Submission
